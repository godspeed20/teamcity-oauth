= Configuration

Plugin supports oAuth2 authentication using:

* github
* bitbucket
* google
* custom oAuth server.

If you want to use github you need an application to be created https://github.com/settings/applications/new[https://github.com/settings/applications/new]. `Authorization callback URL` should be homepage of TC.

Login as administrator and go to Administration &gt; Authentication

Switch to advanced mode and add module HTTP-OAUTH.v2.

You need to specify your client id and client secret.
Also you need to specific scope, `user` is fine for github, 'account' for bitbucket.

If you dont choose "Allow creating new users on the first login" only users that already exists in Teamcity can login.
TC matches user by username (id), so you can interchange between oAuth2 and manual login if needed.

You can decide if you want to hide user/password form on login screen (worth leaving unchecked when you test it).

You can also consider disabling "Allow user registration from the login page" in "Built-in" module.

Save and test out.

Login at your Teamcity host.

= Development

Plugin can be built and deployed by running `gradle deployToTeamcity`

Teamcity instance for testing can be setup by using `docker-compose up`
